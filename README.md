# docker-dev-env-template
A project template for a development environment entirely within docker containers.

After executing the `run` target in the Makefile, you can connect to the container via VSCode's [Remote Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.remote-explorer) extention and have a new IDE working inside the container.
